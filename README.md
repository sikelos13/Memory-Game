# Memory Game Project 
This is a simple game built for the purpose of Udacity Nanodegree Programme.

## Getting Started
This is a simple game built to test a users memory. There's a deck of cards with different icons.
You need to flip all the cards and match the pairs. 

## How to Play
Run index.html at your local broswer.

## Instructions
* Click on a card
* Keep revealing cards and working your memory to remember each unveiled card.
* Match cards properly with less moves and in faster time


## How I built the Memory Game
I worked on a static template given by Udacity.I manipulated DOM with vanilla js exept the modal that i use a script.
* created a deck of cards that shuffles when game is refreshed
* created the functions when cards are matched or unmatched
* created a counter to count the number of moves made by player and timer to know the duration of a play
* added effects to cards when they match and are unmatched
* create a pop-up modal when player wins game
